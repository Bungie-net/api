(for simplicity purposes, we will henceforth refer to earned progression points as experience, though it need not be a mechanic that in any way resembles Experience in a traditional sense).\r\nEarned experience is calculated in a variety of ways, determined by the Progression's scope.

Items have both Stats and a reference to a Stat Group, and it is the Stat Group that takes the raw stat information and gives it both rendering metadata (such as whether to show it as a number or a progress bar) and the final transformation data (interpolation tables to turn the raw investment stat into a display stat).  Please see DestinyStatGroupDefinition for more information on that transformational process.\r\nStats are segregated from Stat Groups because different items and types of items can refer to the same stat, but have different \"scales\" for the stat while still having the same underlying value.  For example, both a Shotgun and an Auto Rifle may have a \"raw\" impact stat of 50, but the Auto Rifle's Stat Group will scale that 50 down so that, when it is displayed, it is a smaller value relative to the shotgun.  (this is a totally made up example, don't assume shotguns have naturally higher impact than auto rifles because of this)\r\nA final caveat is that some stats, even after this \"final\" transformation, go through yet another set of transformations directly in the game as a result of dynamic, stateful scripts that get run. BNet has no access to these scripts, nor any way to know which scripts get executed.  As a result, the stats for an item that you see in-game - particularly for stats that are often impacted by Perks, likeMagazine Size - can change dramatically from what we return on Bungie.Net.  This is a known issue with no fix coming down the pipeline.  Take these stats with a grain of salt.\r\nStats actually go through four transformations, for those interested:\r\n1) \"Sandbox\" stat, the \"most raw\" form.  These are pretty much useless without transformations applied, and thus are not currently returned in the API.  If you really want these, we can provide them.  Maybe someone could do something cool with it?\r\n2) \"Investment\" stat (the stat's value after DestinyStatDefinition's interpolation tables and aggregation logic is applied to the \"Sandbox\" stat value)\r\n3) \"Display\" stat (the stat's base UI-visible value after DestinyStatGroupDefinition's interpolation tables are applied to the Investment Stat value.  For most stats, this is what is displayed.)\r\n4) Underlying in-game stat (the stat's actual value according to the game, after the game runs dynamic scripts based on the game and character's state.  This is the final transformation that BNet does not have access to.  For most stats, this is not actually displayed to the user, with the exception of Magazine Size which is then piped back to the UI for display in-game, but not to BNet.)",

These are implemented as Vendors, where you can't actually purchase from them but the items that they have for sale and the categories of sale items reflect the rewards or contents of the sack. This is so that the game could reuse the existing Vendor display UI for rewards and save a bunch of wheel reinvention.\r\n- Item Transfer capabilities, like the Vault and Postmaster.  Vendors can have \"acceptedItem\" buckets that determine the source and destination buckets for transfers.  When you interact with such a vendor, these buckets are what gets shown in the UI instead of any items that the Vendor would have for sale.  Yep, the Vault is a vendor.\r\nIt is pretty much guaranteed that they'll be used for even more features in the future.  They have come to be seen more as generic categorized containers for items than \"vendors\" in a traditional sense, for better or worse.\r\nWhere possible and time allows, we'll attempt to split those out into their own more digestible derived \"Definitions\": but often time does not allow that, as you can see from the above ways that vendors are used which we never split off from Vendor Definitions externally.\r\nSince Vendors are so many things to so many parts of the game, the definition is understandably complex.

Global = The gating on this item is based entirely on global game state.  It will be gated the same for everyone. Clan = The gating on this item is at the Clan level.  For instance, if you're gated by Clan level this will be the case. Profile = The gating includes Profile-specific checks, but not on the Profile's characters.

For BNet, this generally implies that we'll show this data only on a character level or deeper. AssumedWorstCase = The unlocks and checks being used for this calculation are of an unknown type and are used for unknown purposes. For instance, if some great person decided that an unlock value should be globally scoped, but then the game changes it using character-specific data in a way that BNet doesn't know about.

To figure out which of these properties is actually live, you'll need to combine the definition with \"Live\" data from one of the Destiny endpoints.\r\nActivities also have Activity Types, but unfortunately in Destiny 2 these are even less reliable of a source of information than they were in Destiny 1.

In Destiny 2, for now, talent grids have become exclusively used by Subclass/Build items: but the system is still in place for it to be used by items should the direction change back toward talent grids.\r\nTalent Grids have Nodes: the visual circles on the talent grid detail screen that have icons and can be activated if you meet certain requirements and pay costs.  The actual visual data and effects, however, are driven by the \"Steps\" on Talent Nodes.  Any given node will have 1:M of these steps, and the specific step that will be considered the \"current\" step (and thus the dictator of all benefits, visual state, and activation requirements on the Node) will almost always not be determined until an instance of the item is created.  This is how, in Destiny 1, items were able to have such a wide variety of what users saw as \"Perks\":they were actually Talent Grids with nodes that had a wide variety of Steps, randomly chosen at the time of item creation.\r\nNow that Talent Grids are used exclusively by subclasses and builds, all of the properties within still apply: but there are additional visual elements on the Subclass/Build screens that are superimposed on top of the talent nodes.  Unfortunately, BNet doesn't have this data: if you want to build a subclass screen, you will have to provide your own \"decorative\" assets, such as the visual connectors between nodes and the fancy colored-fire-bathed character standing behind the nodes.\r\nDestinyInventoryItem.talentGrid.talentGridHash defines an item's linked Talent Grid, which brings you to this definition that contains enough static data about talent grids to make your head spin.  These *must* be combined with instanced data - found when live data returns DestinyItemTalentGridComponent - in order to derive meaning.  The instanced data will reference nodes and steps within these definitions, which you will then have to look up in the definition and combine with the instanced data to give the user the visual representation of their item's talent grid.",

The \"Sub-Type\" is where we classify and categorize items one step further in specificity: \"Auto Rifle\" instead of just \"Weapon\" for example, or \"Vanguard Bounty\" instead of merely \"Bounty\".\r\nThese sub-types are provided for historical compatibility with Destiny 1, but an ideal alternative is to use DestinyItemCategoryDefinitions and the DestinyItemDefinition.itemCategories property instead. Item Categories allow for arbitrary hierarchies of specificity, and for items to belong to multiple categories across multiple hierarchies simultaneously.  For this enum, we pick a single type as a \"best guess\" fit.\r\nNOTE: This is not all of the item types available, and some of these are holdovers from Destiny 1 that may or may not still exist.",

Talent Grids, in Destiny 1, were found on almost every instanced item: they had Nodes that could be activated to change the properties of the item. In Destiny 2, Talent Grids only exist for Builds/Subclasses, and while the basic concept is the same (Nodes can be activated once you've gained sufficient Experience on the Item, and provide effects), there are some new concepts from Destiny 1.  Examine DestinyTalentGridDefinition and its subordinates for more information. This is the \"Live\" information for the current status of a Talent Node on a specific item. Talent Nodes have many Steps, but only one can be active at any one time: and it is the Step that determines both the visual and the game state-changing properties that the Node provides.  Examine this and DestinyTalentNodeStepDefinition carefully. *IMPORTANT NOTE* Talent Nodes are, unfortunately, Content Version DEPENDENT.  Though they refer to hashes for Nodes and Steps, those hashes are not guaranteed to be immutable across content versions.  This is a source of great exasperation for me, but as a result anyone using Talent Grid data must ensure that the content version of their static content matches that of the server responses before showing or making decisions based on talent grid data."
